## Why prime.css?
Look, we've all been there - drowning in a sea of dependencies, fighting with build tools, and wondering why something so simple became so complex. That's why I created prime.css.
Think of it as htmx's companion. While htmx handles your Ajax needs, prime.css takes care of everything else you need for a clean, responsive UI - without the bloat.


## Core Principles

- Zero Build Tools: Drop it in and it works
- HTML-First: Works directly with HTML elements - no special classes or frameworks to learn
- Browser-Native: Embraces and enhances native browser components
- Minimalistic: Every feature has to earn its place
- Fast: Minimal CDN links, maximum performance

## Contributing
I'll be honest - this is early stage stuff. I've borrowed ideas and code from other MIT-licensed projects (standing on the shoulders of giants, right?). If you're tired of complexity and want to build something truly simple and useful, I'd love your help.
