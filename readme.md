## Why?
As a web developer working with **Django** and inspired by the minimalistic approach of **HTMX**, 
I created this repository to bundle together a few essential front-end tools. 
The goal is to provide an easy way for developers to get started with web development, with the most commonly used libraries included in a simple, one-shot CDN.


## Why Use This Bundle?

- **Minimalistic**: Contains only the most essential libraries to get started, so you donâ€™t have to worry about bloated code.
- **Quick Setup**: Just use the CDN provided in this repo to include all the required packages in your project in one go.
- **Django Friendly**: Perfect for developers using Django as their backend framework, since it's designed with that in mind.
- **Future Proof**: The project is open to adding more libraries and improvements, and contributions are welcome.
